    <h2>Linux Structure</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Many events led up to creating the first Linux kernel and, ultimately, the Linux operating system (OS), starting
        with the Unix operating system's release by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (whom both worked for AT&T at the
        time) in 1970. The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was released in 1977, but since it contained the Unix
        code owned by AT&T, a resulting lawsuit limited the development of BSD. Richard Stallman started the GNU project
        in 1983. His goal was to create a free Unix-like operating system, and part of his work resulted in the GNU
        General Public License (GPL) being created. Projects by others over the years failed to result in a working,
        free kernel that would become widely adopted until the creation of the Linux kernel.</p>
    <p>At first, Linux was a personal project started in 1991 by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds. His goal was to
        create a new, free operating system
        kernel.
        Over the years, the Linux kernel has gone from a small number of files written in C under licensing that
        prohibited
        commercial distribution to the latest version with over 23 million source code lines (comments excluded),
        licensed
        under the GNU General Public License v2.</p>
    <h3>Linux Distributions</h3>
    <p>Linux is available in over 600 distributions (or an operating system based on the Linux kernel and supporting
        software and libraries). Some of the most popular and well-known being Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE,
        elementary, Manjaro, Gentoo Linux, RedHat, and Linux Mint.
    </p>
    <h3>Security and Stability</h3>
    <p>Linux is generally considered more secure than other operating systems, and while it has had many kernel
        vulnerabilities in the past, it is becoming less and less frequent. It is less susceptible to malware than
        Windows
        operating systems and is very frequently updated. Linux is also very stable and generally affords very high
        performance to the end-user. However, it can be more difficult for beginners and does not have as many hardware
        drivers as Windows.</p>
    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Linux follows five core principles:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Principle</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Everything is a file</td>
            <td>All configuration files for the various services running on the Linux operating system are stored in one
                or more text files.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Small, single-purpose programs</td>
            <td>Linux offers many different tools that we will work with, which can be combined to work together.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ability to chain programs together to
                perform complex tasks</td>
            <td>The integration and combination of different tools enable us to carry out many large and complex tasks,
                such as processing or filtering specific data results.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Avoid captive user interfaces</td>
            <td>Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell (or terminal), which gives the user greater control over
                the operating system.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Configuration data stored in a text file</td>
            <td>An example of such a file is the <span id="tip">/etc/passwd</span> file, which stores all users
                registered on the system.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>The Linux operating system can be broken down into several components:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Component</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bootloader</td>
            <td>A piece of code that runs to guide the booting process to start the operating system. Parrot Linux uses
                the GRUB Bootloader.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>OS Kernel</td>
            <td>The kernel is the main component of an operating system. It manages the resources for system's I/O
                devices at the hardware level.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Daemons</td>
            <td>Background services are called "daemons" in Linux. Their purpose is to ensure that key functions such as
                scheduling, printing, and multimedia are
                working correctly. These small programs load after we booted or log into the computer.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>OS Shell</td>
            <td>The operating system shell or the command language interpreter (also known as the command line) is the
                interface between the OS and the user.
                This interface allows the user to tell the OS what to do. The most commonly used shells are Bash,
                Tcsh/Csh, Ksh, Zsh, and Fish.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Graphics server</td>
            <td>This provides a graphical sub-system (server) called "X" or "X-server" that allows graphical programs to
                run locally or remotely on the X-windowing
                system.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Window Manager</td>
            <td>Also known as a graphical user interface (GUI). There are many options, including GNOME, KDE, MATE,
                Unity, and Cinnamon. A desktop
                environment usually has several applications, including file and web browsers. These allow the user to
                access and manage the essential and frequently accessed features and services of an operating system.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Utilities</td>
            <td>Applications or utilities are programs that perform particular functions for the user or another
                program.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Linux Architecture</h3>
    <p>The Linux operating system can be broken down into layers:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Layer</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hardware</td>
            <td>Peripheral devices such as the system's RAM, hard drive, CPU, and others.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kernel</td>
            <td>The core of the Linux operating system whose function is to virtualize and control common computer hardware resources like CPU, allocated
                memory, accessed data, and others. The kernel gives each process its own virtual resources and prevents/mitigates conflicts between different
                processes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Shell</td>
            <td>A command-line interface (<b>CLI</b>), also known as a shell that a user can enter commands into to execute the kernel's functions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>System Utility</td>
            <td>Makes available to the user all of the operating system's functionality.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>File System Hierarchy</h3>
    <p>The Linux operating system is structured in a tree-like hierarchy and is documented in the <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy</a>
        Standard (FHS).
        Linux is structured with the following standard top-level directories:</p>
    <img src="linux-filesystem.png" alt="Linux filesystem">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Path</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/</td>
            <td>The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the
                operating system before other filesystems are mounted, as well
                as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are
                mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/bin</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/boot</td>
            <td>Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/dev</td>
            <td>Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/etc</td>
            <td>Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as
                well.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/home</td>

        <tr>
            <td>/mnt</td>
            <td>Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/opt</td>
            <td>Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/root</td>
            <td>The home directory for the root user.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/tmp</td>
            <td>The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. This directory is
                generally cleared upon system boot and may be
                deleted at other times without any warning.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/usr</td>
