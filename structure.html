    <h2>Linux Structure</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Many events led up to creating the first Linux kernel and, ultimately, the Linux operating system (OS), starting
        with the Unix operating system's release by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (whom both worked for AT&T at the
        time) in 1970. The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was released in 1977, but since it contained the Unix
        code owned by AT&T, a resulting lawsuit limited the development of BSD. Richard Stallman started the GNU project
        in 1983. His goal was to create a free Unix-like operating system, and part of his work resulted in the GNU
        General Public License (GPL) being created. Projects by others over the years failed to result in a working,
        free kernel that would become widely adopted until the creation of the Linux kernel.</p>
    <p>At first, Linux was a personal project started in 1991 by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds. His goal was to
        create a new, free operating system
        kernel.
        Over the years, the Linux kernel has gone from a small number of files written in C under licensing that
        prohibited
        commercial distribution to the latest version with over 23 million source code lines (comments excluded),
        licensed
        under the GNU General Public License v2.</p>
    <h3>Linux Distributions</h3>
    <p>Linux is available in over 600 distributions (or an operating system based on the Linux kernel and supporting
        software and libraries). Some of the most popular and well-known being Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE,
        elementary, Manjaro, Gentoo Linux, RedHat, and Linux Mint.
    </p>
    <h3>Security and Stability</h3>
    <p>Linux is generally considered more secure than other operating systems, and while it has had many kernel
        vulnerabilities in the past, it is becoming less and less frequent. It is less susceptible to malware than
        Windows
        operating systems and is very frequently updated. Linux is also very stable and generally affords very high
        performance to the end-user. However, it can be more difficult for beginners and does not have as many hardware
        drivers as Windows.</p>
    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Linux follows five core principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Everything is a file</li>
        <li>Small, single-purpose programs</li>
        <li>Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks</li>
        <li>Avoid captive user interfaces</li>
        <li>Configuration data stored in a text file</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>The Linux operating system can be broken down into several components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bootloader</li>
        <li>OS Kernel</li>
        <li>Daemons</li>
        <li>OS Shell</li>
        <li>Graphics server</li>
        <li>Window Manager</li>
        <li>Utilities</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Linux Architecture</h3>
    <p>The Linux operating system can be broken down into layers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hardware</li>
        <li>Kernel</li>
        <li>Shell</li>
        <li>System Utility</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>File System Hierarchy</h3>
    <p>The Linux operating system is structured in a tree-like hierarchy and is documented in the Filesystem Hierarchy
        Standard (FHS).
        Linux is structured with the following standard top-level directories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>/</li>
        <li>/bin</li>
        <li>/boot</li>
        <li>/dev</li>
        <li>/etc</li>
        <li>/home</li>
        <li>/lib</li>
        <li>/media</li>
        <li>/mnt</li>
        <li>/opt</li>
        <li>/root</li>
        <li>/sbin</li>
        <li>/tmp</li>
        <li>/usr</li>
        <li>/var</li>
    </ul>
