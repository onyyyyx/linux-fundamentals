		<h2>Linux Distrubution</h2><hr>
		<p>
			Linux distributions - or distros - are operating systems based on the Linux kernel. They are used for various purposes, from servers and
embedded devices to desktop computers and mobile phones. Each Linux distribution is different, with its own set of features, packages, and
tools. Some popular examples include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">Red Hat Entreprise Linux</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Many users choose Linux for their desktop computers because it is free, open source, and highly customizable. Ubuntu and Fedora are two
popular choices for desktop Linux and beginners. It is also widely used as a server operating system because it is secure, stable, and reliable
and comes with frequent and regular updates. Finally, we, as cybersecurity specialists, often prefer Linux because it is open source, meaning
its source code is available for scrutiny and customization. Because of such customization, we can optimize and customize our Linux
distribution the way we want and configure it for specific use cases only if necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can use those distros everywhere, including (web) servers, mobile devices, embedded systems, cloud computing, and desktop
computing. For cyber security specialists, some of the most popular Linux distributions are but are not limited to:

		<h3>Debian</h3>
		<p>Debian is a widely used and well-respected Linux distribution known for its stability and reliability. It is used for various purposes, including
			desktop computing, servers, and embedded system. It uses an Advanced Package Tool (apt) package management system to handle
			software updates and security patches. The package management system helps keep the system up-to-date and secure by automatically
			downloading and installing security updates as soon as they are available. This can be executed manually or set up automatically.</p>
		<p>Debian can have a steeper learning curve than other distributions, but it is widely regarded as one of the most flexible and customizable
			Linux distros. The configuration and setup can be complex, but it also provides excellent control over the system, which can be good for
			advanced users. The more control we have over a Linux system, the more complex it feels to become. However, it just feels that way
			compared to the options and possibilities we get. Without learning it with the required depth, we might spend way more time configuring
			“easy” tasks and processes than when we would learn to use a few commands and tools more in-depth. We will see it in the <span id="tip">Filter
			Contents</span> and <span id="tip">Find Files and Directories</span> sections.</p>
		<p>Stability and reliability are key strengths of Debian. The distribution is known for its long-term support releases, which can provide updates
			and security patches for up to five years. This can be especially important for servers and other systems that must be up and running 24/7. It
			has had some vulnerabilities, but the development community has quickly released patches and security updates. In addition, Debian has a
			strong commitment to security and privacy, and the distribution has a well-established security track record. Debian is a versatile and reliable
			Linux distribution that is widely used for a range of purposes. Its stability, reliability, and commitment to security make it an attractive choice
			for various use cases, including cyber security.</p>
